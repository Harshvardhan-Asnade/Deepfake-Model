# 🎤 Hackathon Presentation Script (Tech Expo 2026)

**Instructions**: Copy the text below into your PowerPoint slides. Use the images provided in the `presentation_assets` folder.

---

## 1️⃣ Slide 1: Title Slide
**Headline**: DeepGuard: The Future of Truth
**Sub-headline**: Advanced Multi-Modal Deepfake Detection
**Presenter**: [Your Name/Team Name]

---

## 2️⃣ Slide 2: The Problem
**Headline**: Seeing Is No Longer Believing
**Bullet Points**:
*   AI Generators (Midjourney, DALL-E) are now photorealistic.
*   Deepfakes are used for fraud, misinformation, and harassment.
*   Human eyes can't spot the difference anymore.
*   **We need a digital forensic expert that never sleeps.**

**Image Suggestion**: Use `presentation_assets/real_vs_fake.png`.
*(This image shows a side-by-side comparison explaining that while humans see a face, AI spots glitches).*

---

## 3️⃣ Slide 3: Our Solution
**Headline**: DeepGuard - A 4-Brain AI System
**Text**:
Unlike other detectors that just look at pixels, DeepGuard analyzes the image in **4 Dimensions**. It’s like having 4 different detectives working on the same case.

**Image Suggestion**: Use `presentation_assets/architecture_diagram.png`.
*(This diagram visually explains the 4 branches: Eye, Waveform, Magnifying Glass, and Network).*

## 4️⃣ Slide 4: How It Works (The 4 Brains)
**Headline**: Under the Hood
**Bullet Points**:
1.  **👁️ Visuals (RGB)**: Looks for "plastic" skin and warped backgrounds.
2.  **📉 Frequencies (Hidden Signals)**: Detects invisible "grid patterns" left by AI generators.
3.  **🔍 Details (Patches)**: Zooms in on small errors like hands, eyes, and earrings.
4.  **🧠 Context (ViT)**: Checks if the lighting and shadows make physics sense.

---

## 5️⃣ Slide 5: Explainability (Trust)
**Headline**: We Don't Just Guess, We Show You Why.
**Text**:
DeepGuard provides a **Heatmap** to prove its verdict. Red areas show exactly where the fake parts are.

**Image Suggestion**: 
*   **Left**: `presentation_assets/1_original.jpg` (Original Image)
*   **Right**: `presentation_assets/3_heatmap_overlay.jpg` (AI Vision Overlay)

---

## 6️⃣ Slide 6: Technology Stack
**Headline**: Built With State-of-the-Art Tech
**Bullet Points**:
*   **Core**: Python & PyTorch
*   **Models**: EfficientNetV2 + Swin Transformer
*   **Speed**: < 40ms per image (Real-time)
*   **Security**: SafeTensors (No malicious code)

---

## 7️⃣ Slide 7: Future Scope
**Headline**: What's Next?
**Bullet Points**:
*   🎥 **Video Detection**: Real-time deepfake spotting in Zoom/Meet.
*   📱 **Mobile App**: Verify news on your phone.
*   🛡️ **Browser Extension**: Auto-flag fake images on Twitter/Instagram.

## 8️⃣ Slide 8: Thank You
**Headline**: Let's Protect Reality.
**Text**: Open for Questions.
